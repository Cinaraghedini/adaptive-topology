# adaptive-topology
Approach to providing more efficient network topologies regarding connectivity maintenance, robustness to failures and area coverage. 

# Title
A model for e?cient adaptive ad-hoc multi-robot network topologies

## Description
This research proposes a model that aims at providing more e?cient network topologies addressing the issues of connectivity maintenance, collision avoidance, robustness to failure and area coverage improvement.

## Package Information

The package contains source codes, examples of outcomes and documents that support the experiments reprodution. The main folder encompasses:

- Database: network topologies used for simulations.
- Documents: research  papers and scientific reports.
- Matlab: model implementation sources develop in Matlab.
- Results: example of outcomes generated by simulation for 10 networks.

File setup.pdf details the main packages.
