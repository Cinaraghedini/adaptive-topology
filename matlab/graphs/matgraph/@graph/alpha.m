function [a,S] = alpha(g)
% [a,S] = alpha(g) --- indepencence number
% returns a, the independence number of the graph g, and an independent set
% S of maximum cardinality.
% Note: Uses linear programming, so requires Matlab's optimization toolbox
% and may work slowly (if at all) on large graphs.

M = double(M');

c = -ones(1,n);
b = ones(m,1);

x = bintprog(c,M,b);

a = sum(x);
