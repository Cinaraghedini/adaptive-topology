\begin{multicols}{2}[\section*{Overview}]

\matgraph\ is a toolbox for working with simple\footnote{Simple graphs
  are undirected graphs without loops or multiple edges.} graphs in
\matlab. The goal is to make interactive graph theory exploration
simple and efficient. 

In order to use this toolbox, you need a copy of \matlab, available
from The MathWorks. A few of the \matgraph\ functions require the
additional Optimization Toolbox, also available from The MathWorks.

This document gives an overview of the \matgraph\ toolbox. More
information can be found in the accompanying web pages (see
\S\ref{sect:documentation}). 


In addition to providing a \verb|graph| class, \matgraph\ also
defines helper classes for working with permutations
(see~\S\ref{sect:perms}) and partitions
(see~\S\ref{sect:partition}).

\label{sect:getting}

\subsection{Download and install}

\matgraph\ is available for free from my web site. Go to
\begin{verbatim}
http://www.ams.jhu.edu/~ers/matgraph
\end{verbatim}
and select the link in the sentence
``You can download Matgraph by \underline{clicking here}.''

This should cause the file \verb|matgraph-X.X.tgz| to be downloaded to
your computer. (The \verb|X.X| is the version number.) This is a
compressed archive. To unpack on a UNIX system, give the command
\begin{verbatim}
tar xfz matgraph-X.X.tgz
\end{verbatim}
(where \verb|X.X| is replaced by the correct version number). On other
computers, double clicking on the file's icon should serve the same
purpose.

This should create a directory named \verb|matgraph|. You may move
this directory to any convenient location on your hard drive.

\begin{multicols}{2}[\section{Using \matgraph}]
\label{sect:using}


\subsection{Basic principles}
\label{subsect:basic-principles}
We assume the reader is familiar with \matlab. Before we discuss how
to use \matgraph, it is crucial that the following basic principles be
understood.
\begin{itemize}
\item All graphs handled by \matgraph\ are simple and undirected. That
  is, these graphs do not have loops or multiple edges. Each pair of
  distinct vertices either is not adjacent or else is joined by a
  single edge.

\item The vertex set of all graphs in \matgraph\ is always of the form
  $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ where $n\ge0$ is the number of vertices in the
  graph. 

  An important consequence of this is that when a vertex is deleted
  from a graph, all vertices with higher value are renumbered. 
  
\item All graphs in \matgraph\ are specially defined \verb|graph|
  objects. They do not behave in the same manner as, say, matrices in
  \matlab. For the sake of efficiency, \matgraph\ functions are
  capable of modifying their arguments.
  
  Most \matlab\ functions use \emph{call by value} semantics. That is,
  a \emph{copy} of the argument is sent to the function. For example,
  suppose we have a function named \verb|func| defined in a file
  \verb|func.m|. In \matlab, issuing the command \verb|func(A)| does
  not affect the value held in the ordinary variable \verb|A|.
  
  \matgraph, however, is designed differently. Function arguments of
  type \verb|graph| use \emph{call by reference} semantics. This means
  that a command such as \verb|add(g,2,4)| can modify the graph
  \verb|g| (in this case, by adding an edge joining vertices \verb|2|
  and \verb|4|).
  
  Not all \matgraph\ functions modify their arguments, but they all
  use call by reference for \verb|graph| arguments. For functions that are
  capable of modifying graphs, the graph that is modified is always the
  \emph{first} argument to the function. For example, \matgraph\
  provides a \verb|line_graph| function. The command
\begin{verbatim}
line_graph(g,h)
\end{verbatim}
  overwrites \verb|g| with the line graph of \verb|h|. The graph
  \verb|h| is not affected. For more detail, see \S\ref{subsection:declare}.

\item As a consequence of how graphs are stored in \verb|matgraph|,
  the only time a \verb|graph| variable should appear on the left hand
  side of an assignment statement is when the variable is initialized
  like this:
\begin{verbatim}
g = graph
\end{verbatim}
  At no other time should a \verb|graph| variable appear to the left
  of an equal sign.

\end{itemize}




\subsection{Starting \matgraph}
\label{subsect:getting-started}

Launch \matlab\ and be sure that the \matgraph\ directory is visible
on \matlab's path. This can be done with \matlab's \verb|addpath|
function. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
addpath('/home/betty/programming/matgraph/')
\end{verbatim}
assuming Betty placed the \verb|matgraph| directory inside a folder
named \verb|programming| on her computer. 

The next step is to initialize the \matgraph\ system. This is done
by giving the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
graph_init
\end{verbatim}
This sets up hidden data structures (see
\S\ref{sect:under-the-hood}) used by \matgraph. 
\matlab\ responds:
\begin{verbatim}
Graph system initialized. Number of slots = 500.
\end{verbatim}
\matgraph\ is now ready to work with graphs. By default, the system
can handle 500 different graphs. This should be adequate for most
purposes. However, if you need an array of, say, 1000 graphs, then
this is not sufficient. Alternatively, \matgraph\ may be initialized
with an explicit argument specifying the number of ``slots'' (place
holders for graphs) like this:
\begin{verbatim}
graph_init(20000)
\end{verbatim}

If you ever wish to delete all of the hidden data structures
(and thereby erasing all graphs held therein), use the function
\verb|graph_destroy|. 


See also\footnote{See \S\ref{sect:documentation} for a description of
  the web-based information on all \matgraph\ functions. When we
  direct the reader to see a particular function, we typically mean to
  view that function's documentation with a web browser or by using
  \matlab's \texttt{help} command.}  the
\verb|free_all|, \verb|num_available|, and \verb|max_available|
functions.




\subsection{Declaring \texttt{graph} objects and memory management}
\label{subsection:declare}



Before working with graphs, it is necessary to declare variable(s) to
be of type \emph{graph}. This runs against \matlab's philosophy that
variables do not need to be declared, but is necessary for the sake of
efficiency. 

To declare a variable, say \verb|g|, to be of type \emph{graph}, we 
give the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
g = graph;
\end{verbatim}
It is helpful to read this as ``let $g$ be a graph.'' 
\textbf{This is the only circumstance in which a graph object may
  appear to the left of an equal sign.}

Behind the scenes, one of the ``slots'' allocated for graphs (by
\verb|graph_init|) is set aside for the graph \verb|g|.

Every time a \verb|graph| variable is declared, one these slots is
taken to hold the data for the graph. If a \verb|graph| variable is no
longer needed, then its slot can be released like this:
\begin{verbatim}
free(g)
\end{verbatim}
If, inadvertently, a \verb|graph| variable is cleared from \matlab's
workspace, there is no convenient way to free the slot it occupied. 

Freeing a graph's slot is not generally necessary when working at
\matlab's command prompt. Graphs can be modified repeatedly and one
need not declare more graph variables than the number of graphs one is
currently considering. 

However, releasing the slot held by a graph is \emph{vital} in
\verb|.m| files. It is often useful for a function to declare a
\verb|graph| variable temporarily. {\bfseries Every graph that is
  created using the \texttt{g=graph} constructor must be released by
  a matching call to \texttt{free(g)}.} Otherwise, each time the
function is invoked, another slot in \matgraph's hidden data structure
is consumed until no slots remain available.

To make a copy of a graph, we must \emph{not} use the statement
\verb|h=g|. Rather, use \verb|copy(h,g)|. 




\subsection{Basic graph operations}

The statement \verb|g=graph| creates a new graph with no vertices or
edges. It is now possible to add and to delete vertices and edges
using the \verb|resize|, \verb|add|, and \verb|delete| functions.  For
each of these, the graph to be modified is the first argument (see the
discussion of basic principles in \S\ref{subsect:basic-principles}).

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|resize(g,n)| changes the number of vertices in \verb|g| to
  the value held in \verb|n|. If \verb|n| is greater than the number
  of vertices in \verb|g|, then additional, isolated vertices are
  added. On the other hand, if \verb|n| is less than the number of
  vertices in \verb|g|, then the highest numbered vertices are deleted
  leaving a graph with \verb|n| vertices. For example, if \verb|g| has
  $10$ vertices and we invoke the command \verb|resize(g,7)|, then
  vertices $8$, $9$, and $10$ are deleted (and all edges incident on
  these vertices are also deleted). 

\item \verb|add(g,u,v)| adds an edge between \verb|u| and \verb|v| to
  the graph. If either of these values is nonpositive, or if they are
  equal, nothing happens. If either \verb|u| or \verb|v| is greater
  than the number of vertices currently in \verb|g|, the graph is
  expanded to have $\max\{$\verb|u|,\verb|v|$\}$ vertices. 
  
  Another way to use \verb|add| is like this: \verb|add(g,elist)|
  where \verb|elist| is a $k\times 2$ array of positive integers. Each
  row of \verb|elist| is considered an edge, and all of these edges
  are added to the graph. If any end point of any edge is larger than
  the number of vertices currently in the graph, the graph is resized
  to accommodate.

  The automatic resizing has the potential side effect of adding
  isolated vertices. For example, if \verb|g| has 5 vertices, and we
  then give the command \verb|add(g,3,7)| the graph is resized to have
  $7$ vertices. Vertex $6$ is added as an isolated vertex.
  
  Remember: The vertex set of all graphs in \matgraph\ are always of
  the form $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ where $n\ge0$.


\item \verb|delete| is used to delete vertices or edges from a
  graph. 

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|delete(g,v)| deletes the vertex \verb|v| from the graph.
    (If \verb|v| is not a vertex of the graph, there is no effect.)
    
    All vertices with number greater than \verb|v| have their values
    decreased by $1$. For example, suppose \verb|g| is a path graph
    with edges $1\sim2\sim3\sim4\sim5$.  When we give the command
    \verb|delete(g,3)| vertex $3$ is deleted from the graph, and
    vertices $4$ and $5$ get renamed $3$ and $4$, respectively.  Thus,
    after \verb|delete(g,3)| the vertex set of \verb|g| is
    $\{1,2,3,4\}$ and the only edges are $1\sim2$ and $3\sim4$.
    
  \item \verb|delete(g,vlist)| deletes an entire set of vertices. In
    this form, \verb|vlist| is a $k\times 1$ array of positive
    integers. All vertices in \verb|vlist| are deleted from the graph,
    and then vertices are renamed so the vertex set remains of the
    form $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$.
    
    For example, if \verb|g| is a cycle on 5 vertices with edges
    $1\sim2\sim3\sim4\sim5\sim1$, then \verb|delete(g,[2;3])| deletes
    vertices $2$ and $3$ from the graph (leaving edges $4\sim 5 \sim
    1$) and then renumbers vertices 4 and 5 with the new names 2 and
    3, so the final result is the path $2\sim3\sim1$.
    
  \item \verb|delete(g,u,v)| deletes the edge between \verb|u| and
    \verb|v| from the graph. If this edge is not present in the graph,
    nothing happens.
    
  \item \verb|delete(g,elist)| deletes a list of edges from the graph.
    The variable \verb|elist| must be a $k\times 2$ array of positive
    integers. 
  \end{itemize}
  
  Point to notice: \verb|delete(g,[3;4])| deletes vertices 3 and 4
  from the graph (second argument is a column vector) whereas
  \verb|delete(g,[3,4])| deletes the edge $3\sim4$ from the graph
  (second argument is a $k\times 2$ array where $k$ happens to equal
  $1$).

  See also the \verb|clear_edges| function that deletes all edges from
  a graph.

\end{itemize}


See also \verb|set_matrix| (described in
\S\ref{subsect:graph-matrix}). See also \verb|contract|. 


\subsection{Standard graphs}

\matgraph\ provides several functions for forming standard
graphs. One of the more versatile is the \verb|complete| function for
creating complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and complete
multipartite graphs:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|complete(g)| adds all possible edges to \verb|g| without
  changing its vertex set.

\item \verb|complete(g,n)| sets \verb|g| to be the complete graph
  $K_n$. 

\item \verb|complete(g,n,m)| sets \verb|g| to be the complete
  bipartite graph $K_{n,m}$.

\item \verb|complete(g,list)| sets \verb|g| to be the complete
  multipartite graph $K(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_t)$ where the indices are the
  entries in \verb|list|. 
\end{itemize}

Other general graph builders include \verb|path|, \verb|cycle|,
\verb|grid|, \verb|wheel|, \verb|cube|, \verb|circulant|, and
\verb|paley|. 
Specific graphs can be formed using these: \verb|bucky|,
\verb|dodecahedron|, \verb|icosahedron|, \verb|octahedron|, and
\verb|petersen|.
Various random graphs can be built using these functions:
\verb|random|,
\verb|sprandom|,
\verb|random_bipartite|, and \verb|random_regular|.


\subsection{Graph operations}

\matgraph\ provides a variety of operations to form new graphs from
old. For example, \verb|line_graph(h,g)| sets \verb|h| to be the line
graph\footnote{The line graph of $G$ is a graph $L(G)$ whose vertex
  set is $E(G)$. Two vertices $e_1$ and $e_2$ of $L(G)$ are adjacent
  in $L(G)$ provided, when considered as edges of $G$, they are
  incident with a common vertex.}  of \verb|g|.  Other operations
include \verb|cartesian|, \verb|complement|, \verb|mycielski|,
\verb|induce|, \verb|intersect|, \verb|union|, and \verb|trim|.

Breadth-first and depth-first spanning trees can be found using
\verb|bfstree| and \verb|dfstree|. See also \verb|nsptrees|. 

\subsection{Graph inspectors}
\label{subsect:inspectors}

The functions \verb|nv(g)| and \verb|ne(g)| give the number of
vertices and edges of \verb|g|. These two values are returned by
\verb|size(g)| in a $1\times2$ array. 

There are two ways to see if an edge is present in a graph \verb|g|.
The command \verb|has(g,u,v)| returns $1$ (for true) if the edge
between \verb|u| and \verb|v| is present in \verb|g|, and $0$
otherwise. Alternatively, the same result is produced by
\verb|g(u,v)|.

The neighborhood of a vertex is returned by the command
\verb|neighbors(g,v)|; the result is a list (one-dimensional array) of
the vertices adjacent to \verb|v|. The same result is returned by
\verb|g(v)|. 

The degree of a vertex is given by \verb|deg(g,v)|. With only a single
argument, \verb|deg(g)| returns the degree sequence of the graph.

\verb|find_path(g,u,v)| finds a shortest path from \verb|u| to
\verb|v| (returned as a list of vertices on the path); if no such path
exists, an empty array is returned. 

\verb|isconnected(g)| returns $1$ (true) if \verb|g| is connected and
$0$ (false) otherwise. 

The components of a graph can be found using
\verb|components(g)|. This returns a partition object (see
\S\ref{sect:partition}) each of whose blocks is the vertex set of a
component of \verb|g|.

The distance between vertices can be found with
\verb|dist(g,u,v)|. The form \verb|dist(g,u)| returns an array giving
the distances from \verb|u| to all the vertices in the graph. Calling
\verb|dist(g)| returns a square matrix giving the distances between
all pairs of vertices. See \verb|diam|.



\subsection{Graph--matrix conversions}
\label{subsect:graph-matrix}

The adjacency matrix of a graph is returned by \verb|matrix(g)|. This
returns a square \emph{logical} matrix. To use this matrix
arithmetically, convert it to class \verb|double|; for example, the
following command returns the eigenvalues of (the adjacency matrix
of) a graph:
\begin{verbatim}
eig(double(matrix(g)))
\end{verbatim}

Conversely, given a square, symmetric, zero-one, zero-diagonal matrix
\verb|A|, we can set \verb|g| to have this matrix as its adjacency
matrix like this: \verb|set_matrix(g,A)|. 

See also \verb|spy|, \verb|laplacian|, and \verb|incidence_matrix|. 


\subsection{Graph invariants and partitions}
\label{subsect:invariants}

In addition to basic information functions described in
\S\ref{subsect:inspectors}, \matgraph\ can calculate other invariants
and features of graphs of interest to graph theorists. These include
\verb|alpha| (independence number), \verb|omega| (clique number), and
\verb|dom| (domination number). (All three of these use the integer
programming facilities in \matlab's Optimization Toolbox.)
See also \verb|diam|. 

The \verb|bipartition| function determines whether a graph is
bipartite;  if it is, it returns the bipartition as a \verb|partition|
object (see \S\ref{sect:partition}). Otherwise (the graph is not
bipartite) \verb|bipartition| returns an empty partition.

A graph coloring algorithm is available in the \verb|color| function.
This returns a partition of the vertex set of a graph into independent
sets by a greedy coloring algorithm (step through the vertices in
decreasing degree order and give the first available color to each
vertex in turn). Alas, this generally does not find a coloring with
$\chi(G)$ colors. 

The chromatic polynomial of a graph can be found for small
graphs. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
>> g = graph;
>> cycle(g,5)
>> chromatic_poly(g)
ans =
     1    -5    10   -10     4     0
\end{verbatim}
shows that the chromatic polynomial of $C_5$ is
$$x^5-5x^4+10x^3-10x^2+4x.$$



\subsection{Input-output}
\label{subsect:io}

\matgraph\ can read and write graphs in files on the user's hard
disk. 

Suppose the user wishes to build a graph using some other software
(such as a C program written by the user) and then read that graph
into \matgraph. To do this, the data should be saved in a file as a
list of edges. Each line of the file should contain exactly two
integers separated by white space. These integers should range from
$1$ to the number of vertices in the graph.
Let's say that this data is saved in a file named \verb|mygraph|. 

The \matlab\ command \verb|load mygraph| reads the file \verb|mygraph|
and saves the contents of that file in a variable that is also named
\verb|mygraph|. (\matlab's current working directory must be the same
as the directory that contains the file \verb|mygraph|.)

The variable \verb|mygraph| is an $m\times 2$ array of edges. This can
be converted into a graph like this:
\begin{verbatim}
g = graph(mygraph)
\end{verbatim}
or if the graph \verb|g| already exists, like this:
\begin{verbatim}
resize(g,0)
add(g,mygraph)
\end{verbatim}
(The \verb|resize(g,0)| clears all data from \verb|g|.)

\matgraph\ also provides its own \verb|save| and \verb|load| commands.
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|save(g,filename)| saves the graph \verb|g| to the user's
  hard drive in a file named in \verb|filename|. (For example,
  \verb|save(g,'mygraph')|.)  This saves all the information about the
  graph and not just a list of edges.
  
\item \verb|load(g,filename)| reads the graph data in the file named
  in \verb|filename| and sets \verb|g| to be that graph. The file
  named in \verb|filename| must be one created by \matgraph's
  \verb|save| command and \emph{not} just a list of edges. 
\end{itemize}


\matgraph\ provides a function named \verb|sgf| which stands for
\textbf simple \textbf graph \textbf format. This function converts
graphs to and from a 2-column matrix whose rows have the following
meanings:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first row is $[n~m]$ where $n$ is the number of vertices and
  $m$ is the number of edges in the graph.

\item The next $m$ rows give the edges of the graph; each row is of
  the form $[u~v]$ where $1 \le u\not=v \le n$.

\item Optionally, an additional $n$ rows give the locations of the
  vertices. Row number $m+1+i$ is $[x_i~y_i]$ and specifies the
  coordinates of vertex $i$. 
\end{itemize}
Matrices of this form are easy to read or to write on disk, and this
format is easy for other programs to produce. 


In addition, it is possible to create \verb|.m| files for saving
graphs to be used by other programs. For example, \matgraph's
\verb|dot| command writes graphs to disk in a format that can be
processed by GraphViz's \verb|dot| program. See also \verb|graffle|. 


\subsection{Handling large graphs}
\label{subsect:large}

Behind the scenes, graphs in \matgraph\ are saved as square matrices.
A graph with, say, ten thousand vertices would occupy an array with
100~million entries. \matlab\ provides the ability to handle matrices
large matrices with few nonzero entries efficiently. This ability is
embedded into \matgraph.

Small graphs are best handled using full storage. By default, a
graph created by \verb|g = graph| uses full storage. It is easy,
however, to convert a graph to use sparse storage.

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|sparse(g)| converts a graph's storage method to be
  sparse. This is useful for extremely large graphs with relatively
  few edges (i.e., small average degree).

\item \verb|full(g)| converts a graph's storage to full mode. This is
  the preferred method for small graphs and graphs with many edges.
\end{itemize}

One can check the type of storage in use with the \verb|issparse| and
\verb|isfull| functions.

\smallbreak

The graph constructor \verb|g = graph| takes an optional argument; one
can write \verb|g = graph(n)| where \verb|n| is a nonnegative
integer. This creates a new graph with \verb|n| vertices. If \verb|n|
is small, full storage is used for \verb|g|. If \verb|n| is large,
sparse storage is automatically provided. How large is ``large''? See
\verb|set_large|. 


\subsection{Labels}

Naming vertices as consecutive integers from $1$ to $n$ can be
inconvenient. \matgraph\ provides a means to assign text labels to
vertices. The command \verb|label| can be used to assign such labels
to vertices: \verb|label(g,v,string)| assigns the characters in
\verb|string| to be a label for vertex \verb|v|. If a vertex of a
graph is deleted, all higher numbered vertices are renumbered, but
their labels are retained. The command \verb|get_label| is used to
learn the label of an individual vertex or to return a list of all
labels on all vertices  in a graph. See also \verb|clear_labels|.



\subsection{Visualization}

It is often useful to be able to see pictures of graphs. \matgraph\
provides a basic means to do this. 

One may associate an embedding with a graph; this is a mapping from
the vertex set to points in the plane.

The command \verb|draw| draws a picture of the graph in the plane by
placing each vertex at its $x,y$-coordinates and joining adjacent
vertices by line segments. See also \verb|ndraw| and \verb|ldraw|.
Note that \verb|draw| simply draws the graph in the current figure
window without erasing the contents of that figure; to see only the
graph, first give the \matlab\ command \verb|clf|.

When \verb|draw| is invoked for graphs without embeddings, a default,
circular embedding is automatically constructed. Some graph building
operations attach an embedding to the graphs they form; for example,
\verb|petersen(g)| sets \verb|g| to be the Petersen graph with
vertices located at classic coordinates. 

It is possible to set a graph's embedding to coordinates of your
choosing with the \verb|embed| command. If \verb|g| has $n$ vertices
and \verb|xy| is an $n\times2$ matrix of real numbers, then
\verb|embed(g,xy)| sets the coordinates of the vertices to the
corresponding rows of \verb|xy|. The command \verb|randxy(g)| sets the
coordinates of the vertices to random locations. 

To learn the current embedding of a graph, use \verb|getxy(g)|. To
erase a graph's embedding, use \verb|rmxy(g)|. See also \verb|hasxy|.

Two \matgraph\ methods are provided to calculate embeddings based on
the graph's structure: \verb|springxy| and \verb|distxy|. Both of
these require \matlab's Optimization Toolbox and are only useful for
small graphs. Both use the graph's current embedding as a starting point
for an optimal embedding (but with different objective functions for
the two methods). 

\verb|springxy| finds an embedding by modeling vertices as repelling
objects with edges acting as springs that attract the nodes they join.
\verb|distxy| attempts to place vertices in the plane so that their
Euclidean distance matches their graph theoretic distances; greater
emphasis is given to vertices at smaller distances. Of these,
\verb|distxy| runs faster and gives reasonable results.

Readers are warmly encouraged to submit other embedding algorithms
for incorporation into \matgraph.

In addition, the user may get help on any \matgraph\ command with
\matlab's usual \verb|help| command. Some command names are
overloaded. For example, the name \verb|delete| is both a built-in
\matlab\ command and a \matgraph\ function. Type 
\verb|help graph/delete| to access the \matgraph\ version. 

For a list of all methods available for \verb|graph| objects, type
\verb|methods graph|.

\begin{multicols}{2}[\section{The Permutation Class}]
\label{sect:perms}

Included in this toolbox is a class called \verb|permutation|. These
objects represent permutations of the integers $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$.
Unlike \verb|graph|s, these object behave according to the usual
\matlab\ conventions and do not need to be specially
declared. \verb|permutation| objects are used by \matgraph's
\verb|renumber| command.

The standard way to build a permutation $p$ is to specify its action with
a vector of the form $[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n]$ where $a_i = p(i)$.  For
example:
\begin{verbatim}
>> p = permutation( [2 1 3 5 6 4] )
(1,2)(3)(4,5,6)
\end{verbatim}
This assigns to $p$ a permutation in which $p(1) =2$, $p(2) = 1$,
$p(3)=3$, $p(4)=5$, $p(5)=6$, and $p(6)=4$. Note that $p$ is displayed
on the console using the standard disjoint cycle notation.

The basic operations of applying a permutation to an element and
composition of permutations are implemented. Typing \verb|p(k)|
returns the action of the permutation $p$ on the element $k$. If $k$
is not in scope (outside the range $1$ to $n$), then $0$ is returned.
Composition of permutations is denoted by multiplication, \verb|*|.
Repeated composition can be achieved using the \verb|^| operator:
\verb|p^3| is equivalent to \verb|p*p*p|. The power may be zero or
negative.

Equality and inequality of permutations can be checked with \verb|==|
and \verb|~=|, respectively. 

Here are the functions defined for the class \verb|permutation|. Their
\verb|.m| files are found in the \verb|@permutation| folder.

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|array|: convert a permutation to an array. The syntax is
  \verb|array(p)|. This returns a $1 \times n$ array whose
  $i^{\text{th}}$ entry if $p(i)$. For example, if
  $p=(1,2)(3)(4,5,6)$, then \verb|array(p)| returns
  the array $[2 ,1 ,3 ,5 ,6 ,4]$. 

\item \verb|cycles|: determine  the cycle structure of a
  permutation. The syntax is \verb|cycles(p)|. This returns a cell
  array. Each member of the cell array contains the elements (in
  order) of a cycle of $p$. For example, if $p=(1,2)(3)(4,5,6)$, then 
  \verb|c=cycles(p)| sets \verb|c{1}| to $[1,2]$, \verb|c{2}| to
  $[3]$, and \verb|c{3}| to $[4,5,6]$. 

\item \verb|inv|: permutation inverse. The syntax is
  \verb|inv(p)|. This returns the inverse permutation,  $p^{-1}$. 

\item \verb|length|: number of elements permuted. The syntax is
  \verb|length(p)|. For example, if $p=(1,2)(3)(4,5,6)$, then
  \verb|length(p)| is $6$. 
  
\item \verb|matrix|: return a permutation matrix that represents the
  permutation. The syntax is \verb|matrix(p)|. For example, if
  $p=(1,2)(3)(4,5,6)$, then \verb|matrix(p)| gives this:
\begin{verbatim}
     0     1     0     0     0     0
     1     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     1     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0     0     1
     0     0     0     1     0     0
     0     0     0     0     1     0
\end{verbatim}


\item \verb|permutation|: class constructor. This can be called two
  ways. If $n$ is a positive integer, \verb|permutation(n)| returns
  the identity permutation on $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. If $x$ is an array
  containing the elements $1$ through $n$, then \verb|permutation(x)|
  creates the permutation specified by those elements. For example, if
  $x$ is \verb|[2 1 3 5 6 4]|, then \verb|permutation(x)| gives the
  permutation $(1,2)(3)(4,5,6)$.

  
\item \verb|random|: shuffle a permutation. The syntax is
  \verb|random(p)|. This returns a permutation on the same elements as
  $p$ but in a random order.  Typically, to generate a random
  permutation on $n$ elements, one would type this:
  \verb|random(permutation(n))|.

\item \verb|sign|: sign (parity) of a permutation. The syntax is
  \verb|sign(p)|. This returns $1$ is $p$ is an even permutation and
  $-1$ is $p$ is an odd permutation.

\item \verb|size|: give the number of elements and number of cycles in
  a permutation. The syntax is \verb|size(p)|. This returns a
  two-element array. The first element is the number of objects
  permuted by the permutation and the second element is the number of
  cycles in the disjoint-cycle representation of $p$. 
  
  \matlab\ uses this when reporting on permutation variables in the
  workspace. The permutation $(1,2)(3)(4,5,6)$ is described as a
  \verb|<6x3 permutation>|. The $6$ refers to the fact that this is a
  permutation of the set $\{1,2,\ldots,6\}$ and the $3$ refers to the
  fact that this permutation has $3$ cycles. 
\end{itemize}

\end{multicols}\hrule
\begin{multicols}{2}[\section{The Partition Class}]
\label{sect:partition}
The \verb|partition| class represents partitions of sets of the form
$\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. A partition can be created with the command
\verb|p=partition(n)|. This creates a partition in which all parts
have size $1$; that is, the partition
$\bigl\{\{1\},\{2\},\ldots,\{n\}\bigr\}$. A partition can also be
created from a cell array. Each cell in the array should list the
elements of a block; the integers $1$ through $n$ should appear
exactly once in each member of the cell array. For example, if we type
\begin{verbatim}
c = {[1 2 4],[3 5 6],[7:10]};
p = partition(c)
\end{verbatim}
Then $p$ is the partition
$\bigl\{\{1,2,4\},\{3,5,6\},\{7,8,9,10\}\bigr\}$ and \matlab\ types
this:
\begin{verbatim}
{ {1,2,4} {3,5,6} {7,8,9,10} }
\end{verbatim}

If $p$ is a partition and $k$ is an integer, the expression
\verb|p(k)| returns the elements in the same part as $k$. For the
partition presented above, \verb|p(2)| would return the array
\verb|[1 2 4]|.  For integers $j$ and $k$, the expression
\verb|p(j,k)| returns true if $j$ and $k$ are in the same part of $p$
and false otherwise.

The meet and join of two partitions is computed using \verb|p*q| and
\verb|p+q|, respectively. Equality and inequality can be checked with
\verb|==| and \verb|~=|.

Partitions can be converted into cell arrays with the \verb|parts|
function. 

Here is a list of the various functions defined for the
\verb|partition| class; these can be found in the \verb|@partition|
folder.

\begin{itemize}

\item \verb|merge|: combine two parts. The syntax is
  \verb|merge(p,j,k)|. This returns a new partition in which the parts
  containing $j$ and $k$ have been merged into a single part. 


\item \verb|np|: number of parts. The syntax is \verb|np(p)|; the
  number of parts in the partition is returned.

\item \verb|nv|: size of the ground set. The syntax is \verb|nv(p)|;
  the number of elements in the ground set of the partition is
  returned. 
  
\item \verb|partition|: constructor for this type. The simple syntax
  is \verb|partition(n)| (where $n$ is a positive integer). This
  builds a partition with ground set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ in which there
  are $n$ parts (all of size one).

  Alternatively, if $c$ is a cell array, then \verb|partition(c)|
  creates a partition based on the arrays in $c$. Each of \verb|c{1}|,
  \verb|c{2}|, and so on, is a list of integers. Together, these lists
  should contain each of the integers in $[n]$ exactly once.

\item \verb|parts|: get the parts of the partition. The syntax is
  \verb|parts(p)|. This returns a cell array. Each cell contains a
  list (vector) of positive integers in one of the parts of $p$. 



\item \verb|size|: report the number of elements in the ground set and
  the number of parts. The syntax is \verb|size(p)|. This returns a
  $1\times2$ array \verb|[n m]| where $n$ is the size of the ground
  set and $m$ is the number of blocks. 

  This is used by \matlab\ when it reports the variables in a
  workspace. A partition is reported like this:
  \verb|<10x3 partition>|. This means the partition's ground set is
  $[10]$ and there are three parts in the partition.

\begin{multicols}{2}[\section{Under the Hood (Stuff You Don't Need to Know)}]
\label{sect:under-the-hood}


All data about graphs are held in a hidden global data structure named
\verb|GRAPH_MAGIC|. Objects of type \verb|graph| are simply indices
into this structure. This enable us to simulate call-by-reference
semantics for \emph{graph} objects; that is, \matlab\ functions can
modify \emph{graph} arguments. 

It is possible to save the entire \verb|GRAPH_MAGIC| structure into
another variable; this would allow multiple ``graph theory universes''
to coexist. It's not clear this is needed.

\subsection{The \texttt{GRAPH\_MAGIC} structure}

The global data structure is named \verb|GRAPH_MAGIC|. To access this
structure directly, use the following line in your \verb|.m| files:
\begin{verbatim}
global GRAPH_MAGIC
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|GRAPH_MAGIC| structure contains the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|ngraphs|: the number of ``slots'' available in this
  structure (equal to the size of the arrays \verb|GRAPH_MAGIC.graphs|
  and \verb|GRAPH_MAGIC.in_use|).

\item \verb|graphs|: this is a cell array containing the graphs. (See
 \S\ref{inside-GM.g}.)


\item \verb|in_use|: an array that indicates which slots are taken. A
  $1$ in position $i$ of this array signals that slot $i$ is taken; a
  $0$ means the slot is available to hold a new graph.

\item \verb|Q|: a structure implementing a double-ended queue. (See \S\ref{Q}.)

\item \verb|large_size|: a variable holding the cutoff between
  ``large'' and ``small'' graphs. If the graph constructor
  \verb|graph| is fed a large argument, it creates a sparse graph. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inside \texttt{GRAPH\_MAGIC.graphs}}
\label{inside-GM.g}

The cell array \verb|GRAPH_MAGIC.graphs|  holds the graphs. Each cell in
this array is a structure with two fields: \verb|array| and
\verb|xy|. The \verb|array| field holds the adjacency matrix of the
graph (a zero-one, symmetric matrix). The \verb|xy| field holds the
embedding for the graph; this is an $n\times 2$ array of real values
giving the coordinates of the vertices.


\subsubsection{The private double-ended queue}
\label{Q}

The \verb|Q| field of \verb|GRAPH_MAGIC| is a double-ended queue
available for use by \verb|graph| algorithms (e.g.,
\verb|bfstree|). It is a structure that contains three fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|array|: a one-dimensional array that holds the stack/queue
  values.
\item \verb|first|: an index pointing to the first (front most) element
  of the queue.
\item \verb|last|: an index pointing to the last (back most) element of
  the queue.
\end{itemize}

There is a small suite of tools for working with the queue in the
directory \verb|@graph/private|. These are visible to functions inside
the \verb|@graph| directory, but not generally available. Here they
are (in alphabetical order):

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|q_capacity|: gives the maximum capacity of the queue.

\item \verb|q_get|: returns a list of the elements in the queue (that
  is, \verb|array(first:last)|).

\item \verb|q_init|: called with one argument, this initializes the queue
  with a given capacity.

\item \verb|q_pop_back|: pops off (and returns) the last element of
  the queue. This is a stack-like operation.

\item \verb|q_pop_front|: pops off (and returns) the front most element in the
  queue. This is a queue-like operation.

\item \verb|q_push|: called with one argument, this adds an element to
  the back of the queue.

\item \verb|q_size|: returns the number of elements in the queue. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The \texttt{graph} type}

The \emph{graph} type is simply a ``wrapper'' for an integer; that
integer is an index into the \verb|GRAPH_MAGIC.graphs| array.  A
\emph{graph} object contains just one field, \verb|idx|, which holds
that integer.

In many \emph{graph} functions (in the \verb|@graph| directory) we see
the following:
\begin{verbatim}
GRAPH_MAGIC.graphs{g.idx}.array
\end{verbatim}
This is how we refer to the adjacency matrix of the graph \verb|g|.

\begin{multicols}{2}[\section{Future Projects}]

There are many additions I would like for this project. Here are
few:
\begin{itemize}
\item Planarity testing and embedding. I would like an \verb|is_planar|
  method to test if a graph is planar and a good \verb|planar_embed|
  method for finding a crossing-free embedding.

\item The current \verb|springxy| routine is extremely slow and gives lousy
  results. The newer \verb|distxy| is better, but  hardly fast. Both
  rely on the Optimization Toolbox. I'd like a better layout engine.

\item A GUI for creating and editing graphs. I'd like to see this
  invoked with a command such as \verb|gui(g)| or
  \verb|graph_edit(g)|.
  
\item We need \verb|.m| files for connectivity, edge connectivity,
  maximum matching (in general graphs), isomorphism, approximate
  isomorphism, better heuristic coloring algorithms, girth, and so
  forth.
\end{itemize}
