Welcome to MATGRAPH: A Matlab toolbox for working with simple graphs
(undirected graphs without loops or multiple edges). 

There is documentation in the doc directory and web-based information
in the html directory. 

To install, placed the directory "matgraph" anywhere that is
convenient. Use MATLAB's "addpath" command to include a link to this
directory. 

Graph variables behave a bit differently from standard MATLAB
variables. Please be sure to read matgraph.pdf to understand how to
use this package. 

In addition to the graph class, we also include classes for
permutations and partitions. 

Please read the copyright notice. This software is distributed under
the GNU General Purpose License (see gpl.txt). 

Your comments and help are greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
