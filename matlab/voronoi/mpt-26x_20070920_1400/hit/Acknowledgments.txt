Some .m functions of the HIT toolbox have been adapted from existing ones
written by different people. 

As a general rule, if a function name does not begin with "hit_" it
is mainly the work of other researchers.

In particular, let me acknowledge:

- Steve Gunn. The svc.m code has been adapted from Steve's "MATLAB Support
  Vector Machine Toolbox"
  http://www.isis.ecs.soton.ac.uk/resources/svminfo/

- Glenn Fung. The psvc.m code is its psvm.m file downloadable at 
  http://www.cs.wisc.edu/dmi/svm/

- Ian Nabney and all the people working on the NetLab toolbox.
  The code of the modified kmeans algorithm is based on the kmeans.m routine of
  NetLab

- All the people at ETH that contributed in developing early algorithms for PWA    systems. In particular A. Bemporad, F. Borrelli D. Mignone and F. Torrisi.
  Some pieces of their code are used for plotting regions and reducing
  constraints.

- All the people at ETH that developed the MPT toolbox. I have learned
  a lot on MatLab programming from their work ! A special thank goes to Michal 
  Kvasnica for testing early versions of HIT and for promoting the integration
  with MPT.
