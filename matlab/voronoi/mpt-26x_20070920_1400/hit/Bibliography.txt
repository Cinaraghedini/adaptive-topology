MAIN ALGORITHM, using Feature Vectors (FV)

  pages = {205-217},
  abstract = {We propose a new technique for the identification of discrete-time hybrid systems in
     the Piece-Wise Affine (PWA) form. This problem can be formulated
     as the reconstruction of a possibly discontinuous PWA map with a
     multi-dimensional domain. In order to achieve our goal, we provide
     an algorithm that exploits the combined use of clustering, linear
     identification, and pattern recognition techniques. This allows to
     identify both the affine submodels and the polyhedral partition of the
     domain on which each submodel is valid avoiding gridding procedures.
     Moreover, the clustering step (used for classifying the datapoints) is
     performed in a suitably defined feature space which allows also to
     reconstruct different submodels that share the same coefficients but are
     defined on different regions. Measures of confidence on the samples
     are introduced and exploited in order to improve the performance
     of both the clustering and the final linear regression procedure. }

SINGLE-LINKAGE CLUSTERING

  title = {Single-linkage clustering for optimal classification in piecewise affine regression},
  journal = {IFAC Conference on the Analysis and Design of Hybrid Systems (ADHS 03)},
  year = {2003},
  mytype = {referred conference},
  abstract = {When performing regression with
     piecewise affine maps, the most challenging task is to classify the
     data points, i.e. to correctly attribute a data point to the affine
     submodel that most likely generated it. In this paper, we consider a
     regression scheme similar to the one proposed in (Ferrari-Trecate et al.,
     2001,2003) that reduces the classification step to a clustering problem
     in presence of outliers. However, instead of the K-means procedure
     adopted in (Ferrari-Trecate et al., 2001,2003), we propose the use of
     single-linkage clustering that estimates automatically the number of
     submodels composing the piecewise affine map. Moreover we prove that,
     under mild assumptions on the data set, single-linkage clustering
     can guarantee optimal classification in presence of bounded noise. },

     piecewise affine maps. In particular, we focus on the sub-problem of
     classifying the datapoints, i.e. correctly attributing a datapoint to
     the affine submodel that most likely generated it. Then, we analyze
     the regression algorithm proposed by Ferrari-Trecate et. al (2003)
     and show that, under suitable assumptions on the dataset and the
     weights of the classification procedure, optimal classification can be
     guaranteed in presence of bounded noise. We also relax such assumptions
     by introducing and characterizing the property of weakly optimal
     classification. Finally, by elaborating on these concepts, we propose a
     procedure for detecting, a posteriori, misclassified datapoints.},
