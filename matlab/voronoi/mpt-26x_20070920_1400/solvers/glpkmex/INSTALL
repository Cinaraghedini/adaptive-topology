GLPKMEX INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
**********************************


Introduction
-------------

glpkmex.c is a Matlab MEX Interface for the glpk library developed by 
Andrew Makhorin. 



---------------------------
Installing glpkmex on Win*
---------------------------


Compiler: Cygwin/Mingw
-----------------------

Requirements:

A) The last version of cygwin, downloadable from http://cygwin.com
   (or download mingw)
B) Gnumex: http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/gnumex20.html

Instructions:

1/ After you downloaded and installed cygwin, compile the glpk library  
   (glpk-xxx.tar.gz) with the -mno-cygwin option as explained in the
   follow:

   a) ./configure 
   b) edit Makefile and in the CC Flags add -mno-cygwin (This option is 
      used to produce a .exe file that doesn't depend on cygwin1.dll) if 
      you are using cygwin. If you are using mingw leave all as it is.
   c) make
   d) make install

2/ Copy libglpk.a in the directory of glpkmex.c

3/ With gnumex make a mexopts.bat for the 'cygwin-mingw' if you are 
   using cygwin or 'mingw' if you are using mingw.

4/ Compile the mex interface with the following command:
     
      mex -f mexopts.bat -I<path_glpk>/include glpkmex.c libglpk.a
      
5/ Launch Matlab and update your path through menu File/Set Path.. 
   to include
    .../glpk-x.x/contrib/glpkmex/src
    .../glpk-x.x/contrib/glpkmex/doc
   *in that order* (which can be checked with >> path)

6/ Try the .mexmac library on the examples glpktest1.m, glpktest2.m or 
   glpksparse.m.



Compiler: Visual Studio, .NET
------------------------------
Never tried.



------------------------------------------
Installing glpkmex on Linux/Mac OS X 10.3
------------------------------------------

1/ After you have compiled and installed glpk change to directory 
   .../glpk-x.x/contrib/glpkmex/src and type the following command 
   from prompt

        $ <MATLAB-DIR>/bin/mex glpkmex.c -lglpk
        
   to compile the glpkmex.[mexglx|mexmax] library.
        
2/ Launch Matlab and update your path through menu File/Set Path.. 
   to include
    .../glpk-x.x/contrib/glpkmex/src
    .../glpk-x.x/contrib/glpkmex/doc
   *in that order* (which can be checked with >> path)

3/ Try the .mexmac library on the examples glpktest1.m, glpktest2.m or 
   glpksparse.m.

----
Note: A full path to mex has been given in case teTeX is installed and so there is
another mex:
 % which mex
 /usr/local/teTeX/bin/mex
